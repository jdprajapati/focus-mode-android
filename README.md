# Focus Mode - Android (#30DaysOfKotlin)

Focus mode is an android app built with Kotlin programming language which aims at helping user focus on their work timings by avoiding phone calls and notifications.

You can set the schedule for focus mode and turn on/off the silent mode and notifications on your phone.

The app is built with clean design and material components as well as sleek animations.
